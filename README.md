#Marvia-Elevator-Playground

An internship assignment for the company Marvia.

##Task

Build a simple web application in React that simulates a working elevator. The elevator should contain the following:

 -   The elevator must be able to move between five floors
 -   The elevator must contain buttons on the outside that prepare the elevator whether you would like to go up or down
 -   The elevator must contain pressable buttons for all five floors
 -   When pressing buttons when the elevator is moving, the elevator must be able to change its route. For example, when the elevator is on the fifth floor and you press the buttons 0, 1, and 3 in this order, the elevator must recognize that the most efficient order to stop is 3 -> 1 -> 0.

##Constraints

 -   No specific frameworks are required, however, it is recommended to use any tools/frameworks that help to separate the logic from the UI
 -   No data storage or any back-end services are needed, all the logic can live on the client-side
 -   The elevator should simulate a certain delay (X seconds) when moving between floors
 -   No aesthetics are required, just basic functionality; clicks should trigger commands
 -   Preferably use functional components
 -   Preferably use typescript

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
